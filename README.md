## Usage notes
The files need to be in the following directory structure (I know this is not optimal):
.

+-- data

|   +-- pac_data (This is the file resulting from unzipping jan2018.tgz)

|   +-- augmented (empty directory)

+-- scripts

|   +-- image_visual.py

|   +-- classifier.py

+-- saves (empty directory) (will store trained model data)

+-- roc (empty directory) (will store ROC curve data)

Follow run instructions at the bottom of image_visual.py and classifier.py to generate augmented data, train, and evaluate model.
